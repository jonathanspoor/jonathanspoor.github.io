### Who am I?

I've worked in ELT in a variety of roles in the UK, China and Australia, including stints as a teacher, writer, Trinity CertTESOL course director and EAP tutor. I currently work in Academic management. Although blogs are supposedly dead, I wanted to have a space to collect my writing and other projects related to teaching.

### Now

At the moment (late Dec, 2023), I'm currently focused on :

- settling into a new job and working out living in London
- working on my Master's dissertation on the impact of part-time CertTESOL courses
- writing some articles and blog posts related to AI and teaching
- learning some honkyoku by heart - traditional japanese shakuhachi flute music
