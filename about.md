### Who am I?

I've worked in language teaching in a variety of roles in the UK, China and Australia, including stints as a teacher, writer, Trinity CertTESOL course director and EAP tutor. I currently work in Academic management. Although blogs are supposedly dead, I wanted to have a space to collect my writing and other projects.

### Now

At the moment (September, 2024), I'm currently focused on :

- planning future learning projects now that I've finished my Master's dissertation on the impact of part-time CertTESOL courses
- developing a more regular writing habit
- learning some honkyoku by heart - traditional japanese shakuhachi flute music
