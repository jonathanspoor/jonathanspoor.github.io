title: Why I'm posting here and not on LinkedIn
---
I've read in a number of places that blogs are dead and social blogs on LinkedIn are where the good ELT conversation happens, so why on earth am I posting here?

1. I want to spend less time on social media and having a minimalist blog encourages me to focus on writing and making things. On LinkedIn, I find it too easy to get stuck into endless cycles of scrolling and envy towards other people's careers.<br>
2. Although there is a lot of great content on LinkedIn, I'm getting a bit tired of everyone setting themselves up as entrepreneur and their headlines telling me 'I help x to do y through z'. A lot of it feels like shameless advertising with very mediocre content. Some of the language learning tips feel like they have very little to do with how language and learning actually works.<br>
3. I get to learn new skills. Having a blog hosted on Github has meant that I've had to learn a bit of coding and Markdown.<br>
4. I have a record/portfolio of things that I can easily download and I actually own my content rather than rely on a social media network.<br>
5. Finally, I've gained a lot from people's blogs like [Geoff Jordan](http://applingtesol.wordpress.com), [Sandy Millin](http://sandymillin.wordpress.com), [Jim Fuller](http://spongeelt.org) and [Pete Clements](http://eltplanning.com).<br>

I might be wrong,  this might not last, and I might do a bit of shameless promotion of posts on LinkedIn, but I'd like the year ahead for me to be about creating things rather than just consuming things.
